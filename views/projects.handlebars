    A game that was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2024. I and a few others created this game from start to finish in
    less than 4 days. It ended up being much more popular than we expected, being among the top 30 ranked games of
    7,000 entries. As the player, you must dodge asteroids and bullets while you build up your ship and its 
    capabilities by purchasing new parts and attaching them to your ship.

    As part of my Operating Systems class, we were asked to follow along the MIS JOS Labs in which we create an
    operating system. We did everything from indicating where the operating system boots from to creating memory
    management to creating the exception stack.

    For my graphics programming class' final project, I recreated Minecraft's terrain generation from raw OpenGL.
    I first had to devise a way to organize objects into chunks and then how to position those chunks properly.
    Once that was working, I had to research Perlin Noise and figure out how to implement it in such a way that it
    resembles the terrain generation of Minecraft.
