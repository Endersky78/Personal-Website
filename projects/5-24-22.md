Lots has happened since I last made a post. I believe with this commit I will have potentially fixed
the bug that causes only the first three classes to be parsed in experience. It was due to the fact
that I wasn't closing the browser when I was done, causing a memory leak and eating up all my server
memory. 

Since my last post, I had a few big things happen. I got to go to Las Vegas with the marching band, which
was a lot of fun. I went to a Maneskin concert while I was there and got hit in the head by a drum stick,
which left a pretty cool scar. I was also flown out to San Jose to teach at an ID Tech camp. That experience
was amazing, I had so much fun doing that and I'm so proud of all the kids I got to teach. And now, I'm waiting
to finish up my classes and then I'm going to move to Maryland for a summer internship with LPS labs!

In the meantime, I've started on a new project (one which I will hopefully stick with), it will be a game that will
simulate parallelism in programming, but make it into a puzzle game. It's pretty basic right now, but I hope to
continue to work on it! I will try to update this blog post soon with a few images and links once I have some time
at my home pc.
