# Starship Scale

This is a game I created for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2024. I worked in a small team to create this in a little under 4 days. My role was the gameplay programmer. The following document will give an overview of the game and its various systems. The game can be found here.

You get points from destroying enemies and asteroids, those points can be used to purchase upgrades for your ship. 

The enemies come in waves with the goal being to survive ten minutes. As you get further, the enemies will change to reflect the size of player increasing. They can range from small fighter ships to planet destroying behemoths.

The player can purchase upgrades at any time. These upgrades can do a variety of things from increasing the movement speed, to increasing maximum health, to add additional weaponry. We created three types of weapons, the rubble laser, the missile, and the seeking missile. These add new dimensions of complexity to the gameplay and
