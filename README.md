# Personal-Website
This is the source code for my presonal website. I'm currently in the process of taking a web development class,
so I will spend time on it here and there when I want to try something new I've learned, however as a student in
college, making any headway will be difficult. My current plan is to have this website fully finished and posted 
by the end of this summer.
