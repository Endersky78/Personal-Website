I decided to make today my first blog entry. I didn't do anything particularly interesting, I just worked on some class assignments
and now I'm working on this website. I started by researching how to add media queries in the most readable way using Sass. Eventually,
I landed on using mixins, however it wasn't applying properly. After some testing, I figured out that it was only applying if I didn't
specify which device I was emulating which led me to figuring out that I needed to add a meta tag to my html. I will continue working
on the responsive css for my home page and then give the other pages the same treatment when I have more time.
