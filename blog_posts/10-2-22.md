#October 2, 2022

This week has been a very busy week. Luckily I was able to make some time to finish the responsive layouts
today. Thankfully, once I finished the home page, most of the other pages only needed minor edits. Moving forward,
I need to add a hamburger menu for the navbar while on mobile sizes and I need to figure out why my deployment
build only shows the top 3 classes I've taken recently.
