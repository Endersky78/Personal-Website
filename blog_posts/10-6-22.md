I've been wanting to add a GitHub and LinkedIn link to my site for a while now, since I've been told
that having those is very important. I had a little extra time today so I added those in today. Luckily
they play really nice with the mobile site, so I didn't need to make any changes with those for now, but
I definitely need to add a hamburger menu soon. I think that will be the next major change I make.
